      "description": "Breast cancer screening mammogram performed as part of routine preventive healthcare and early detection program for breast cancer, involving comprehensive patient preparation including removal of clothing and jewelry from chest area, proper positioning and compression techniques to optimize image quality and minimize radiation dose, acquisition of standard imaging views including craniocaudal (CC) view providing superior-inferior perspective of breast tissue, mediolateral oblique (MLO) view providing angled lateral-medial perspective that includes maximum breast tissue and axillary tail, with potentially additional views including spot compression, magnification, or specialized views if indicated for better visualization of specific areas, performed using advanced digital mammography technology or potentially digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) also known as 3D mammography providing three-dimensional imaging with improved cancer detection and reduced false positives, using low-dose X-ray imaging technology optimized for breast tissue with appropriate radiation dose reduction techniques, with proper image quality assessment including evaluation of positioning, compression, exposure, and image artifacts, with detailed radiological interpretation by specialized breast imaging radiologist using standardized reporting system such as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) developed by American College of Radiology, evaluating breast tissue density categorized as almost entirely fatty, scattered areas of fibroglandular density, heterogeneously dense, or extremely dense, assessment of architectural patterns including evaluation of breast tissue architecture, symmetry, and normal variations, comprehensive evaluation for presence of masses including assessment of mass size, shape, margins, density, and location, with characterization of mass features to distinguish benign from suspicious findings, evaluation for calcifications including assessment of calcification morphology, distribution, and characteristics to distinguish benign calcifications from suspicious or malignant patterns, assessment of asymmetries including focal asymmetry, global asymmetry, or developing asymmetry evaluation, evaluation for other suspicious findings including architectural distortion, skin or nipple retraction, skin thickening, axillary lymphadenopathy, or other abnormalities, with comprehensive analysis using BI-RADS assessment categories including Category 0 (incomplete, need additional imaging), Category 1 (negative), Category 2 (benign finding), Category 3 (probably benign, short-interval follow-up), Category 4 (suspicious, biopsy recommended), Category 5 (highly suggestive of malignancy), or Category 6 (known biopsy-proven malignancy), with detailed comparison to prior mammograms if available to assess for interval changes or stability of findings, with comprehensive analysis confirming normal breast tissue appearance, appropriate breast tissue density, no evidence of suspicious masses, calcifications, or other lesions, no evidence of architectural distortion or other abnormalities, no evidence of suspicious lymphadenopathy, and normal mammographic findings, with recommendation for continued routine screening according to established guidelines including American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines, or American College of Radiology (ACR) guidelines, with appropriate interval for next screening mammogram based on age, risk factors, and current guidelines, and comprehensive patient communication regarding results, recommendations, and breast health education",
